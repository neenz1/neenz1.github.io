            <p>This is a contemporary design play on the classic novel Dracula.
                I added contrast between the red & white to show hierarchy.
                Overall I wanted to tie the whole theme together by using a  groovy font  to reflect the era of Dracula.

            <p>A simplistic take on an online weather page. I wanted to be heavily icon based.
                I am from the Midwest so I included what I thought would be important information depending on the day.

            <p>Object was to design a poem stylized three different ways on three different screen sizes.
                 Although the designs are different I wanted to play on the same through out by having a common theme,
                 which is repetition.
